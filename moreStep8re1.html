			<p>We support Council Member Levin’s Rental Assistance Vouchers bill (Int 0146-2018) to ensure that households currently receiving rental vouchers will continue to receive them as long as they remain eligible, and ensure that approved rental amounts raise in tandem with fair market rents. His legislation specifically states that there would be "no limit on the period of time during which an otherwise eligible household may receive a rental assistance voucher."</p>
			<p>The multiple types of city-issued vouchers, including LINC, SEPS, and CityFEPS allowed 11,803 households to move from shelter into permanent housing between 2014 and 2016. Rental assistance programs, like these, have been shown to be associated with reduction of homelessness, and are preferred over less stable options, such as transitional housing or rapid re-housing. These programs have been vital in ending people’s experiences of homelessness and we know that continuing rental subsidies to households who have moved into permanent housing can assist these households in maintaining their housing. </p>
			<p>Previous subsidy funding cuts, like the Advantage program, contributed to a 38% increase in homelessness in three years. This program, similar to LINC, was created in 2007, and provided subsidies to individuals who had been in shelter for more than 60 days and who were working at least 20 hours per week. Eligible participants paid 30-40% of their monthly income towards a market rate apartment. The Advantage program ended in 2011, resulting in many participants falling into rental arrears, unable to pay their full rent, leading to eviction and another episode of homelessness.</p>
			<p>Intro 0-146 would finally recognize the issue with time limited vouchers, and we urge continued funding of the newest voucher program, CityFHEPS to ensure continued stable housing for recipients. In addition to the creation of CityFHEPS, implementation of Home Stability Support would further create secure housing opportunities for individuals moving out of homelessness with a voucher. Rental Assistance Vouchers bill (Int 0146-2018) will provide legal protection and support for households benefiting from the introduction of CityFHEPS vouchers. </p>
			<p>It is imperative that CityFHEPS address the shortcomings of the previous voucher programs, like LINC and SEPS. Council Member Stephen Levin, who chairs the City Council’s General Welfare Committee, put forth a number of recommendations to enhance the upcoming CityFHEPS Voucher during a recent Public HRA Hearing on August 21, 2018. We support his ideas, specifically those which will affect individuals who are street homeless. During the Public Hearing on August 21, Council Member Levin recommended that HRA “ensure voucher renewals for eligible residents after five years.” Under the current plan, voucher recipients would have to prove they have “good cause” to extend their voucher beyond the first five years. HRA states that they will consider “health and mental health challenges, department of social services errors, effort to cure the error, or other circumstances beyond the control of the household” as good cause to extend vouchers beyond five years. The new CityFHEPS also promises to extend vouchers beyond five years for households who include a member over the age of 60, or a member who receives or is eligible to receive federal disability benefits. The broad language used by HRA, such as “good cause” or “effort to cure the error,” leaves too much room for interpretation by decision makers at HRA. This could cause confusion for voucher holders about exactly what is needed to secure a renewal.</p>
			<p>The new CityFHEPS vouchers could, if rolled out successfully and with the implementation of Intro-0146, be tremendously helpful to all homeless New Yorkers. It would open up available units immediately as we wait for the city to build more affordable housing units.</p>
