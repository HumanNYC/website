			<p>The faith community has long been part of providing services to those in need, and we recognize the importance of continuing these relationships. We recommend that the collaboration between the Emergency Shelter Network and Department of Homeless Services, including their contracted-providers, is expanded to include outreach programs and other points-of-contact for street homeless individuals. This would allow case managers on the outreach teams to conduct the assessment on the streets. This assessment would be identical to the assessment that case managers in the drop-in centers conduct in the drop-in centers.
			<p>This process would allow outreach teams to directly refer street homeless individuals to respite beds in lieu of going through the referral process at a drop-in center. This process would be an option for street homeless individuals currently engaged and actively working with outreach teams; we envision that the outreach team would provide the psychosocial assessment and a referral with any additional necessary information. This type of referral would eliminate the need for individuals to access drop-in center services first, a possible barrier to accessing respite beds. Due to the changing availability and capacity of respite beds, we recommend that the expansion to outreach teams start with a collaboration with a few select Respite programs. This will allow outreach teams to build relationships with providers, and ensure appropriate referrals and best-fit placements into these limited beds. </p>
			<p>“Those church beds, I’ve never heard one thing bad. And that’s odd, because you normally hear something bad. But never heard anything bad.”</p>
			<p>We believe that respite beds have the opportunity to be a space for individuals who the traditional shelter model has not worked for and who do not yet meet the chronically homeless eligibility requirements for a Safe Haven. However, to effectively provide these services, we recommend that Respite providers become more comfortable and familiar with challenges and barriers that street homeless individuals often face. In one specific respite site in Brooklyn, an outreach staff member stays overnight, every night, in the respite site to support the volunteers and manage any issues that may arise. We believe this practice should be expanded to as many respite sites as possible, as it would alleviate some of the stress of the volunteers who are unsure of what to do in certain situations. Furthermore, increased outreach presence could help make the criteria for acceptance into the respite sites more flexible.</p>
