			<p>New York City has some of the most comprehensive eviction prevention and homelessness prevention programs and policies in the country, including Homebase and Right to Counsel. These programs are vital for keeping people in their homes and from preventing additional cycles of homelessness. Homebase provides immediate assistance to people at risk of homelessness, and connects eligible individuals with case management, legal and career counseling services, and advocacy around outstanding unit repairs. Homebase can also assess if individuals are eligible for housing vouchers that would allow them to avoid eviction and remain in their homes with a more affordable rent portion. For individuals who have fallen behind in rent but can keep up with payments moving forward, the city also provides emergency rental assistance in the form of One Shot Deals, a one-time emergency grant, and through rent arrears assistance programs offered through the Human Resources Administration. </p>
			<p>With the Right to Counsel, individuals are able to receive pro-bono housing court assistance to stay in their home and prevent illegal and unnecessary evictions. Navigating housing court can be overwhelming and intimidating, as tenants without legal aid must dispute with landlords’ attorneys before the judge. Oftentimes, landlords’ attorneys will write up stipulations for tenants to sign in the hallways of housing court, out of sight of the judge and the court attorney. As many tenants feel disempowered going up against licensed attorneys in court, they are often unaware of their rights and the legal process. Furthermore, while people have the right to an interpreter in court, this is unfortunately not always provided, leaving individuals with little understanding as to what they are agreeing to.Right to Counsel, upon its full implementation, will aid in supporting tenants through the housing court process, and can also serve as added advocacy for any necessary repairs in the home.</p>
			<p>Our recommendations do not just include continuing these programs, but ensuring the people have information and access to them. Information about eviction prevention programs including eligibility requirements and how to access these programs should be provided upon move out of transitional programs as well as prior to ending aftercare services.</p>
