			<p>Both <a target="_blank" href="http://picturethehomeless.org/">Picture The Homeless</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vocal-ny.org/">VOCAL-New York</a>, among other organizations, have advocated for further utilization of Our Space. Per Picture The Homeless’ Business of Homelessness report, “Our Space is an additional financing mechanism that HPD can layer on top of its existing term sheets, in order for a portion of units to rent to homeless households at the ‘shelter allowance’ rents set by the state.” In its report, Picture The Homeless states that the city should “Shift DHS capital funding away from the expansion of the shelter system, and reinvest these capital funds into subsidies for extremely low income and homeless households. If $80 million in capital funds were shifted each year from DHS to HPD, the city could nearly double the amount currently invested in the Our Space Initiative, which subsidizes up to 30% of units in a new construction project with rents at the current shelter allowance.”</p>
