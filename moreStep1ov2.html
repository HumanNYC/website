			<p>Theft, violence, and expired/ unhealthy food in shelters are cited as some of the top reasons people choose not to stay in shelters, and instead feel safer or more comfortable sleeping on the sidewalks of New York City. People tell us that when they sleep on the streets, they get to choose who they sleep around and have less fear that their belongings will disappear overnight. Some choose to not even try the shelters after hearing other people’s experiences and reading about the crime and violence within the system. A recent study conducted in Manhattan found that only 58% of its sample of street homeless individuals had previously tried a DHS shelter, suggesting that this narrative is consistent and pervasive. Shelters often do not accommodate for dietary preferences or restrictions and portions are small and providers will not give out additional servings, even where there are excess servings leftover. </p>
